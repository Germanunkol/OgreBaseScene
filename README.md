Base Scene for Ogre using CMake
===========================================

Because it's always such a hazzle to set up Ogre, this is a setup that works for me on Ubuntu 14.04. Should also work on Arch Linux, Windows, Mac. Feel free to use (see License below).

Requirements:
-------------------------------------------

	- Ogre (Tested with version 1.9 from the Ubuntu repositories)
	- OIS (Also taken from the repositories)
	- Boost

License:
-------------------------------------------

Do whatever you want to with this.
Wherever possible, I place this into the public domain. Where this is not possible due to local laws, the "WTF Public License" applies (See http://www.wtfpl.net/).

Note: The files in the cmake/ subfolder are not by me, but are also in the public domain.
Note: This is basically the Minimal Application by _jacmoe_ from the Ogre wiki www.ogre3d.org/tikiwiki/MinimalApplication, extended with CMake scripts, camera movement and a simple scene.
